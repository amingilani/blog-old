A superhero, techie, reader, writer, foodie, and I play my guitar on Sundays, all in that order. I write what I like, but sometimes not, and any opinions I express are usually my own. I can successfully speak two languages (English and Urdu), and stammer an incoherrent mixture of three others (Seraiki, Punjabi, and Gibberish). I hate spinach, and I like my steak rare.

This is where I share my two [aanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_anna) of wisdom.
